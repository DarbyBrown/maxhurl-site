            <p>I joined as a graduate after university with limited Python experience (the core language used at the agency) and picked up the skills needed to produce my first web app within a few months (<a href="http://www.dabapps.com/work/clients/twilbee/">Twilbee</a>). Within 12 months I had gained enough skills and trust to be technical lead on a small scale hybrid app and REST backend (https://www.travelplaces.mobi/).</p>

            <p>I also took the lead on a hybrid angular app and website (<a href="https://www.biteappy.com">Biteappy</a>). For this project I worked with a new graduate hire whom I had to take under my wing. The project included a large amount of functionality within a short deadline which we managed to achieve without cutting too many corners. After this project I became the go-to person for supporting new hires.</p>

            <p>The largest project I have worked on is <a href="https://racgaragecompare.co.uk/">TootCompare</a> (now rebranded). I started this site as a junior developer but as the site and my skills grew I became the project lead. In this role I instigated and implemented a gradual move to a service orientated API driven architecture which allowed us to easily produce several white label sites (<a href="https://bookmygarage.com/">BookMyGarage</a> and <a href="https://garagecompare.gocompare.com/">GoCompare Garage Compare</a>). This allowed a larger team to produce two new sites using more modern technologies without needing to fully understand or amend the legacy code within the core site.</p>

            <p>The role included designing and developing a new company website and CMS, creating hi-res video/animation content, building PC based media servers, designing an iOS app, helping with phone support and producing promotional material. Due to the size and nature of the company’s work no one else had much experience with design, animation or web development. This meant I usually had to resolve my own issues and do a lot of self-directed learning.</p>
