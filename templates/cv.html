            <p>My role at DabApps changed<br/>considerably from when I first joined. As the company grew in team and project size my work needed to adapt with it. This allowed me to get involved with projects at every step of the process from initial discussions with clients through to architecture planning, maintaining automated deployment scripts and large scale refactoring multiple years later.<br/><br/></p>

                <li>Maintaining automated testing suites</li>

            <p>The role included designing and developing a new company website and CMS, creating hi-res video/animation content, building PC based media servers, designing an iOS app, helping with phone support and producing promotional material. Due to the size and nature of the company’s work no one else had much experience with design, animation or web development. This meant I usually had to resolve my own issues and do a lot of self-directed learning.</p>
